(* Problem 8: Deques **********************************************************)
(******************************************************************************)

;; open Assert
;; open Imp

(* A deque (pronounced 'deck') is like a queue, but with the ability
   to insert and delete at both ends. That is, deques are
   "double-ended queues".

   Your task in this problem is to implement deques using doubly
   linked lists of nodes in the heap--i.e., the nodes of these lists
   will have pointers to both the next AND the previous nodes.

   Hint: When working out how to implement these functions, you will
   probably find it VERY HELPFUL to work things out on paper using
   "box and pointer" diagrams in the style of the Abstract Stack
   Machine. *)

(* A deque is represented here like a linked queue but with links in
   both directions.

   A dqnode contains a value and references to the next AND PREVIOUS
   nodes in the structure. *)

type 'a dqnode = {
  v: 'a;
  mutable next: 'a dqnode option;
  mutable prev: 'a dqnode option;
}

type 'a deque = {
  mutable head: 'a dqnode option;
  mutable tail: 'a dqnode option;
}

(****** DEQUE implementation INVARIANT ********)

(* INVARIANT: either...

   The deque is empty, and the head and tail are both None, or

   the deque is non-empty, and
   - head = Some n1 and tail = Some n2, where
      (a) n2 is reachable from n1 by following 'next' pointers
      (b) n2.next = None   (there is no element after the tail)

      (c) n1 is reachable from n2 by following 'prev' pointers
      (d) n1.prev = None   (there is no element before the head)

   - for every node n in the deque:
      (e) if n.next = Some m then
            m.prev = Some n

      (f) if n.prev = Some m then
            m.next = Some n *)

(* The next few functions check whether a given deque satisfies the
   deque invariants. While you do not have to write the code for
   these, take some time to read over them and understand how they
   work. You will find yourself writing functions with similar
   structure below. *)

(* Helper function for 'valid' that checks deque invariants "from head
   to tail."  The tail of the deque is returned if traversal is
   successful. *)

   tail to head."  The head of the deque is returned if traversal is
   successful. *)
let check_to_head (n: 'a dqnode) : 'a dqnode option =

let valid (d: 'a deque) : bool =

   get a heap with a *cycle*---when following a combination of next or prev
   pointers you can get back to where you started. Deques are different from
   queues in that valid deques with length >= 2 will always have cycles. In
   contrast, ordinary queues with cycles are invalid. *)

(****** DEQUE implementation exercises ********)

(* NOTE: add all your tests for the following deque functions to dequeTest.ml.
Look for specified sections to write certain tests. *)

(* Write a function to return a list of elements in the deque, ordered from the
   head to the tail.

   This function should create the list in a single iteration of the deque with
   no additional processing. This means you will get full credit only if you
   implement to_list using tail call recursion. Do not use or reimplement the
   List library functions, @, or reverse (List.rev).

   HINT: Why are those List operations needed for singly-linked queues? *)
let to_list (q: 'a deque) : 'a list =
  if not (valid q) then failwith "to_list: given invalid deque";
  failwith "to_list: unimplemented"

(* Write two functions---insert_head and insert_tail---for adding elements to
   the head and tail of a deque, respectively.

   You may assume that the deque input satisfies the deque invariants.

   Just as with queues, you should update the deque in place, and make sure
   to maintain the invariants. *)
let insert_head (x: 'a) (q: 'a deque) : unit =
  if not (valid q) then failwith "insert_head: given invalid deque";
  failwith "insert_head: unimplemented"

let insert_tail (x: 'a) (q: 'a deque) : unit =
  if not (valid q) then failwith "insert_tail: given invalid deque";
  failwith "insert_tail: unimplemented"


(* Write two functions, remove_head and remove_tail, that remove and then return
   the first and last elements of a deque, respectively.

   These functions should fail if the deque is empty.

   Again, you should update the deque in place, and be sure to maintain the
   deque invariants.

   Your TAs will be manually grading your test cases for these two functions.
   Make sure you've written them in dequeTest.ml! *)
let remove_head (q: 'a deque) : 'a =
  if not (valid q) then failwith "remove_head: given invalid deque";
  failwith "remove_head: unimplemented"

let remove_tail (q: 'a deque) : 'a =
  if not (valid q) then failwith "remove_tail: given invalid deque";
  failwith "remove_tail: unimplemented"

(* Write a function that deletes the last (nearest the tail) occurrence of a
   given element from a deque.

   Your TAs will be manually grading your test cases for this function. Remember
   to add tests to the part marked in dequeTest.ml before completing this
   problem. Use structural equality here because the element "v" 
   doesn't have to be reference equal to the element you want to delete. *)
let delete_last (v: 'a) (q: 'a deque) : unit =
  if not (valid q) then failwith "delete_last: given invalid deque";
  failwith "delete_last: unimplemented"

(* Write a function that deletes the first (nearest the head) occurrence of a
   given element from a deque.

   Your TAs will be manually grading your test cases for this function. Remember
   to add tests to the part marked in dequeTest.ml before completing this
   problem. Use structural equality. *)
let delete_first (v: 'a) (q: 'a deque) : unit =
  if not (valid q) then failwith "delete_first: given invalid deque";
  failwith "delete_first: unimplemented"

(* Write a function to mutate the given deque in-place, so that the order of the
   element is reversed. (i.e.: traversal (such as to_list) visits the nodes in
   the opposite order.)

   In-place means that after reversal, the deque uses the same qnodes as before
   it started.

   It is possible to satisfy the tests for this problem without doing an
   in-place reversal (for example, by removing all of the elements, storing them
   in a list, reversing the list and then inserting the elements back). However,
   this is not the solution we are looking for and you will lose points from
   your style grade if you submit it.

   Your TAs will be manually grading your test cases for this problem. Make sure
   you've written them in dequeTest.ml! *)

   Write a higher-order function that will allow you to write both check_to_tail
   and check_to_head by calling this function. Make sure your new implementation
   behaves like the old one.

   Note: The required functionality will provide you with the ability to do the
   loop in both directions. You could also try making the functionality of the
   loop a parameter of the function like fold does for lists, although we won't
   be testing for that. *)
