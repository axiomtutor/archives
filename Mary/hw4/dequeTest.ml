(* `DequeTest` is used to test the deque implementation from deque.ml. 

   Read through the module, then write your test cases in the space
   provided below.  Your TAs will be grading the completeness of your
   tests. 

   Note: Remember the difference between structural and reference
   equality; think about why you shouldn't be directly comparing 
   deques with the '=' of structural equality. *)

;; print_endline ("\n--- Running tests for Deque ---")

(* Here is a test to help get you started. *)

let test () : bool =
  is_empty (create ())
;; run_test "is_empty: call on empty returns true" test


(* Now, it's your turn! Make sure to comprehensively test all the other
   functions you implemented in deque.ml. It will probably be helpful to
   have the files deque.ml/mli open as you work.

   We provide many test cases for you, so your job here is to finish writing
   tests for `remove_head`, `remove_tail`, `delete_last`, `delete_first`, and
   `reverse`.

   Your TAs will be manually grading the completeness of your test cases. *)

(* INSERT_HEAD TESTS *)

  let d = create () in
